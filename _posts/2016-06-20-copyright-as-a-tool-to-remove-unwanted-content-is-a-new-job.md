The trend of using copyright law for things that it wasn't meant for continues. It doesn't only continue, it has become normal, so normal that we have now new job descriptions. Watch this:

> We are looking for an individual or consultant that has made progress in performing DMCA takedowns, Google de-indexing and has a very good understanding of Internet Law and Google's terms and conditions. 

> Directly, someone who has experience performing DMCA for reputation management purposes of removing negative content. 

> Please only apply if you have already have experience with this and have done it before.

This is one of the new jobs, and it couldn't be more clear: use DMCA for the purpose of removing negative content. That's someone else's content, think content like negative reviews, critical blogs, and the like.

Copyright law wasn't meant to be used to remove negative content. It was meant to offer incentives to authors, to write, design, draw or otherwise create works of authorship, by giving them a set of temporary rights to exclude everyone else from copying, distributing, publicly performing, making derivative works and publicly displaying their works.

With the DMCA however, there are new incentives: to remove unwanted content from the internet. You might need - you see the description of that job ad - experience with doing so. Hey, not everyone is good enough at perverting copyright this way.

The disconcerting part of this ad is its normalcy. It must have felt so natural to who wrote it, and it appears there were 10 to 15 candidates for the new job.

I think TNGCA should contain a good section for copyright misuse, one where clear intention to use DMCA takedowns for the purpose of "removing negative content" will be an element of misuse, and with more consequences than just inability to enforce the misuser's copyright in that particular lawsuit.
