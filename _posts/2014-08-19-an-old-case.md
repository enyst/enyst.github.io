I'm starting this blog with a thought that prompted it in the first place: it's somewhat amazing how much simple, understandable information is contained in courts opinions on basic ideas of copyright, yet despite them being theoretically public, they're not known to people, and an immense amount of energy is sometimes spent on public debates on questions that have been - or should have been if all else is equal - settled. People and corporations debate nowadays in part on the basis of the past, but I don't think that past always says what we think it says.

## An old case

Just this week, I dropped upon a case, [Wheaton v. Peters](https://www.courtlistener.com/scotus/rxe/wheaton-and-donaldson-v-peters-and-grigg/), 1832, US Supreme Court. If you're surprised, you read that right, 1832.

The court is asked to tell if the author has, in common law, a property-like right to their writings, and if the copyright law as developed next in the country reflects that right. In common law means both common law as in England of the previous century, and its "wisdom of the people here" American counterpart, state law.

The court answers:

> "That an author, at common law, has a property in his manuscript, and may obtain redress against any one who deprives him of it, cannot be doubted; but this is a very different right from that which asserts a perpetual and exclusive property in the future publication of the work, after the author shall have published it to the world."

That is to say, common sense - and common law - tells that no one can and should break into one's house (or computer) and take their unpublished manuscript, copy it, publish it or otherwise use it for their purposes, before the author decides to make it available to the world themselves. However, once published, it's a very different law - and a different meaning of the concept of "property", if we still use it - that we have to recourse to, when we talk of copyright.

In some way, I can recognize that common law concept as it has been kept even in some civil law jurisdictions, in Europe: under the name of moral rights. The right to authorship (attribution or credit), anonymity/pseudonymity and integrity (not have a modified work pass as the original, at a minimum), are moral rights. They do not imply yet anything from the other concept, the "exclusive property in the future publication of the work". (To be sure, the framework of moral rights also makes the pass in the area of treating cultural works as property in the measure it allows, in certain jurisdictions, to shut down the unwanted speech when it's expressing itself using the work. But otherwise, taken only in itself, the above doesn't - necessarily - pass that threshold.)

Today, I look at the Wheaton decision and remember the many times I read that copyright is something automatically required by "creativity" and something that "belongs to authors", as if the exclusivity of publishing and the control over who is allowed to build upon works would be _the same_ with the parentage implied in the notion of authorship and/or same with the inalienable right to privacy and choice when and how to publish. It's not. We're using similar words, with different meanings.
