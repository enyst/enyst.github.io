The first question I had on this case is still the first question that comes to mind, in a week session I did reviewing some of the case: why is this a copyright case?

It could and should be so many others. Fraud, fraudulent inducement or misrepresentations, right of publicity, hate speech related harms, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, even unfair competition was suggested (cf. International Documentary Ass'n [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/26/amicus_brief_of_international_documentary_assoc._film_independent_fredrik_gertten_and_morgan_spurlock_iso_defendants.pdf)). With these or others, Garcia can have relief against who wronged her. It seems just for _them_ to pay. Not [trumpets](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1474929), as Litman would call Youtube's role here.

If the question seems rhetorical, it is not: the answers are as simple as seemingly irreconcilable. On one hand, a reason here is precedent: Ninth Circuit law does admit acting performances among copyrightable works (more on that in the next blog), and, importantly, it holds that rights such as right of publicity, when breached by exactly copying or distributing one's acting performance, are preempted by federal copyright law. Contrary to what several briefs and many internet blogs keep saying, Kozinski's holding is not, strictly speaking, novel or unprecedented, on this point.

On the other hand, a persuasive picture is painted by the amicus brief of internet law professors: copyright is precisely the tool to bypass 47 U.S.C. ยง 230, which provides immunity to online intermediaries. In its pertinent part, it's as simple as:

> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

That means that indeed, for all other causes of action except federal copyright (and others like patent), the trumpet has the freedom to decide whether to publish or self-censor at will, absent a court order to the contrary.
The brief contains an enlightening array of examples where people and companies have sought to use copyright to bypass the immunity provided by section 230, such as the [dentist taking copyright assignment](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2013/04/17/you-shouldnt-need-a-copyright-lawyer-to-pick-a-dentist/) over future reviews from unsuspecting patients. Yes, that - and many others - did happen.

These two answers are of course the problem in a nutshell: that's why it seems it has to be a copyright case, says legal precedent on one hand, and that's why it should not be, says experience on the other hand. Whether they are indeed irreconcilable, I'm not sure.
