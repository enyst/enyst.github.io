# Welcome

Hi, there. Welcome around, and make yourself comfortable.

Coffee is on the right desk, that's there, yes, okay. Good Swedish coffee, you will see.

This is my home: stripped down home of a software developer and copyright nerd.

(I don't spend much time here, you see.)

## Short Story

I worked on code, and the most relevant of it is open and free today.

I work on open licensing, copyright advising in creative communities, Free Software, open data, open knowledge, free and open internet.

I work to make copyright and open licensing understandable and known to the individuals that need it in their work - today, that's almost anyone.
