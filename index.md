Welcome, traveler. Make yourself comfortable, and get yourself a coffee. It's black, and I hope you will enjoy it. There, to the right, yes.

## Overview

### About your host

I'm a software developer and a copyright nerd. I write code and words. I write open code and words, that is, and I help people open license their works.

### What you can find here

I take a few pages on this website to introduce myself and my work, in an informal resume kind of way.

[My blog](http://anarres.xyz/archive) on copyright, copyright cases, and free/open licensing will be the main part of this site. I'm importing it from older addresses I had.

### What does the name 'Anarres' even mean?

LeGuin's [_The Dispossessed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed) has inspired this name: Anarres is the world outside the reach of proprietarians. In the book, it's the name of a planet where they didn't have property laws. It is also the name I was using in my internal conversations to express the world where intellectual creations are essentially not property. (Like most of our human history, for that matter.) In this hypothetical world, intellectual creations, "writings" of all kinds, participate to a commons of works available to all.

It's a metaphorical use of LeGuin's world, but one that grew on me. So there we have it.
